    Multiple caches may be used, each of which maintains weak references
    to their values, so as to not delay garbage collection when the caches
    hold the only references to the objects.

    For all Pegl uses, the first cache will be keyed by the _as_parameter_
    attribute, as used by ctypes. Instances must have such an attribute
    (or property), and it must either be hashable itself, or have a value
    attribute that is hashable (as ctypes types do).

    A second cache is used for Display objects (caching them by the
    display_id argument used to create them) and for Config objects
    (caching them by their config_id property).

    A key that is None will not be used to cache any instance (but a key
    that has a value attribute of None can be). When looking up cached
    instances, each cache is searched in order (again skipping any keys
    that are None) until a match is found or all caches have been tried.
