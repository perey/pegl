    """Metaclass for classes whose instances are cached.

    Two caches are used, both of which maintain weak references to their
    values, so as to not delay garbage collection when the caches hold the
    only references to the objects.

    The first cache tracks instances by the _as_parameter_ attribute, as
    used by ctypes. Instances must have such an attribute (or property),
    and it must either be hashable itself, or have a value attribute that
    is hashable (as ctypes types do).

    The second cache tracks instances by another property, _cache_key,
    defined by the class implementation, which must be hashable. This is
    included because there are EGL objects that can be uniquely identified
    in two ways:

    * Display objects can be identified by their handle (an EGLDisplay),
      or by the display_id argument used to create them (which must result
      in the same EGLDisplay handle being returned).
    * Config objects can be identified by their handle (an EGLConfig), or
      by the value of their config_id property.

    An instance will not be held in the second cache if its _cache_key is
    None; this is so that Display instances created without a display_id,
    and Context instances (which don't use the second cache), do not
    overwrite each other.
